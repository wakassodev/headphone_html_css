- A code editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text).


## HTML Concepts

### 1. Document Structure

Understanding the structure of an HTML document is crucial. This project follows the standard structure with `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` tags. Learn about the `<meta>` tags, `<title>`, and how to include external resources.

### 2. Semantic Elements

Semantics in HTML enrich the meaning of the content. Explore the use of semantic elements like `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<article>`, `<section>`, `<aside>`, and `<footer>` to structure your document logically.

### 3. Forms

Forms are essential for user interaction. Learn how to create forms using `<form>`, `<input>`, `<select>`, `<textarea>`, and other form elements. Understand form attributes and how to handle user input.

### 4. Links and Navigation

Navigation is a vital part of web development. This project demonstrates the use of `<a>` tags for links and navigation. Explore internal and external linking, as well as navigation within the document.

## CSS Concepts

### 1. Selectors

CSS selectors determine which elements to style. Learn about different types of selectors, including element selectors, class selectors, ID selectors, and attribute selectors. Understand the specificity of selectors.

### 2. Box Model

The CSS box model defines the layout of elements. Explore the concepts of content, padding, border, and margin. Learn how to control spacing and layout using these box model properties.

### 3. Flexbox

Flexbox is a powerful layout model for designing flexible and responsive layouts. Understand the basics of flex containers and flex items. Learn how to use flex properties for alignment and distribution.

### 4. Responsive Design

Responsive design ensures a consistent user experience across various devices. Learn about media queries and how to create styles that adapt to different screen sizes. Understand the importance of mobile-first design principles.

## Responsiveness Concepts

### 1. Media Queries

Media queries allow you to apply different styles for different devices or screen sizes. Learn how to use `@media` rules to create responsive designs.

### 2. Viewport Meta Tag

The viewport meta tag is crucial for responsive web design. Understand how to use the viewport meta tag to control the viewport's size and scale on different devices.

### 3. Fluid Layouts

Create fluid layouts that adapt to different screen sizes by using percentage-based widths and max-width properties.

### 4. Responsive Images

Learn how to make images responsive by setting their `max-width` to 100% and using the `height: auto` property.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/wakassodev/alx_html_css.git`
2. Open `index.html` in your preferred web browser or deploy the project on a web server for testing.
3. Explore the HTML structure in `index.html`, the styles applied in `css/styles.css`, and how responsiveness is implemented.
